"We survey the literature on social insurance, focusing on recent work that has connected theory
to evidence to make quantitative statements about welfare and optimal policy. Our review
contains two parts. We Örst discuss motives for government intervention in private insurance
markets, focusing primarily on selection. We review the original theoretical arguments for
government intervention in the presence of adverse selection, and describe how recent work has
reÖned and challenged the conclusions drawn from early theoretical models. We then describe
empirical work that tests for selection in insurance markets, documents the welfare costs of this
selection, and analyzes the welfare consequences of potential public policy interventions",Description or Definition or Background Context,"A Hypothesis, Proposition, or Suggestion seeking feedback/input"

"A longer context window does not really lead to a better performing model, due to these reasons:

It may create opportunities for mistakes within the context itself.
Reduced efficiency (cost and latency)
Applying the ZPD theory of education, increasing context length does not expand the ""current understanding zone"" of the LLMs. To expand the zone, the theory recommends a combination of identifying the zone in the first place (the analogy of prompt engineering in LLMs) and tailored instruction (the analogy of instruction tuning in LLMs).


However, this argument is rather speculative since it is making an assumption that the learning process of LLMs and humans are similar to each other (which is not established).","A Hypothesis, Proposition, or Suggestion seeking feedback/input","A Hypothesis, Proposition, or Suggestion seeking feedback/input"

"LLMs excel in English and other prominent languages, but struggle in low-resource languages like those found in Southeast Asia, even those with millions of speakers.
