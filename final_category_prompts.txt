Description or Definition or Background Context: Here is a refined definition for the "Description or Definition or Background Context" label:

**Description or Definition or Background Context:**

A passage that provides a detailed explanation, clarification, or contextual information about a topic, concept, or term, aiming to inform, elaborate, or educate the reader. This category includes descriptions that offer characteristic details, definitions that explain the meaning of a term or concept, and background context that sets the stage for understanding a particular issue or situation. The tone is typically neutral and objective, with a focus on explaining and providing context rather than making claims, stating facts, or presenting opinions.

**Key characteristics:**

* Provides explanatory information to help readers understand a topic, concept, or term
* Offers contextual details, definitions, or background information
* Tends to be neutral and objective in tone, avoiding personal opinions or biases
* Focuses on explaining and educating rather than making claims or stating facts
* May include technical definitions, historical background, or explanatory descriptions

By refining the definition and highlighting the distinct characteristics of this label, we can improve the accuracy of our model and better categorize similar instances in the future.
Claims / Facts / Data / Observation: Here are the refined definitions, examples, and clarifying criteria for each of the true labels:

**Claims**

A claim is a statement that asserts a belief, opinion, or position without necessarily providing evidence or proof. Claims often express a subjective perspective, interpretation, or evaluation. Typical language patterns that indicate a claim include:

* Statements starting with "I think," "I believe," or "In my opinion"
* Evaluative language, such as "good," "bad," "better," or "worse"
* Comparative language, like "the best," "the worst," or "more than"

Examples:

* Clear claim: "The new policy is unfair." (expresses a subjective opinion)
* Borderline case: "The best pizza in town is at Joe's Pizzeria." (expresses a subjective evaluation, but may be influenced by personal experience)

**Facts**

A fact is a statement that can be verified or proven through empirical evidence, observation, or expert consensus. Facts are typically objective and independent of personal opinions or perspectives. Criteria for facts include:

* Verifiability through reliable sources or sensory evidence
* Consistency across multiple observations or measurements
* Lack of evaluative language or subjective interpretation

Examples:

* Indisputable fact: "The Earth orbits the Sun." (verified through scientific observations and evidence)
* Fact requiring context: "The most popular ice cream flavor is chocolate." (may vary depending on the population, region, or survey)

**Data**

Data refers to discrete, objective, and quantifiable information, often in a structured format. Data points can be numbers, measurements, or categorical values. Characteristics of data include:

* Numerical or categorical values
* Specific formats, such as tables, charts, or graphs
* Lack of evaluative language or interpretation

Examples:

* Data point: "The average temperature in July is 25Â°C." (a numerical value)
* Data set: "The top 10 most populous cities in the world are..." (a structured list of categorical values)

**Observations**

An observation is a statement that describes a direct experience, sensory perception, or tangible phenomenon. Observations are typically based on immediate experience or concrete evidence. Characteristics of observations include:

* Descriptive language, focusing on sensory details
* Lack of interpretation, evaluation, or inference
* Often use words like "appear," "seem," or "look like"

Examples:

* Observation: "The sky appears blue today." (describes a direct sensory experience)
* Observation: "The plant has grown 5 cm in the past week." (describes a tangible, measurable phenomenon)

Common pitfalls and areas of confusion:

* Confusing claims with facts or data, especially when evaluative language is used
* Misclassifying observations as claims or hypotheses, especially when they involve subjective interpretation
* Failing to consider context or nuance in differentiating between these concepts

Additional subcategories or fine-grained distinctions that may be helpful:

* Subtypes of claims: opinions, beliefs, accusations, or allegations
* Subtypes of facts: historical facts, scientific facts, or social facts
* Subtypes of data: quantitative data, qualitative data, or metadata
* Subtypes of observations: direct observations, indirect observations, or anecdotal evidence
A Hypothesis, Proposition, or Suggestion seeking feedback/input: **Refined Definition:**

A Hypothesis, Proposition, or Suggestion seeking feedback/input is a statement that presents a tentative or declarative idea, concept, or plan, and explicitly or implicitly invites the audience's opinion, critique, or advice to validate, refine, or improve it. This type of statement is characterized by:

1. **Declarative language**: Using phrases like "I propose," "I suggest," "How about," or "What do you think" to introduce the idea.
2. **Tentative tone**: Expressing uncertainty, doubt, or openness to alternative perspectives, which encourages the audience to provide feedback.
3. **Specificity and clarity**: Presenting a well-defined idea or plan, making it clear what the author is seeking feedback on.
4. **Implicit or explicit call to action**: Inviting the audience to respond, agree, disagree, or provide suggestions to enhance or modify the idea.

**Examples:**

1. **Hypothesis seeking feedback/input**: "Based on the data, I hypothesize that a 10% increase in social media advertising will lead to a 15% increase in sales. Do you think this is a plausible assumption?"
2. **Proposition seeking feedback/input**: "To improve customer retention, I propose implementing a loyalty rewards program. What are your thoughts on this approach?"
3. **Suggestion seeking feedback/input**: "Have you considered partnering with influencers to promote our new product line? Would this be an effective marketing strategy?"

These refined definitions and examples aim to capture the essence of a hypothesis, proposition, or suggestion seeking feedback/input, distinguishing them from informal questions and enabling the model to accurately classify these types of texts.
Reported Issue / Idea / Feedback: Here are the refined definitions for the true label "Reported Issue / Idea / Feedback" with examples:

**Reported Issue:**
A specific problem or error encountered by a user, which hinders their experience or functionality. It is typically characterized by a descriptive statement of the issue, often with a neutral or negative tone.

Examples:

* "The app crashes when I try to login."
* "I'm unable to access my account due to an invalid password error."
* "The website is not loading properly on Chrome."

**Idea:**
A suggestion or proposal for a new feature, improvement, or innovation. It is often marked by a future-oriented tone, with language that implies a potential solution or enhancement.

Examples:

* "It would be great if the app could sync with my calendar."
* "Can you add a dark mode feature to the website?"
* "I think it would be awesome if the product had a customizable dashboard."

**Feedback:**
An evaluation or opinion about a product, service, or experience. It typically expresses a subjective judgment or sentiment, often with a positive, negative, or neutral tone.

Examples:

* "The quality of the material is not as expected."
* "I love the new design, it's so visually appealing!"
* "The customer support team was really helpful and responsive."

To distinguish "Reported Issue / Idea / Feedback" from "Description or Definition or Background Context", look for the following key differences:

* "Description or Definition or Background Context" typically provides a factual or informative statement, whereas "Reported Issue / Idea / Feedback" statements are more goal-oriented, expressing a problem, suggestion, or opinion.
* The tone and language used in "Reported Issue / Idea / Feedback" statements are often more personal and experiential, whereas "Description or Definition or Background Context" statements are generally more objective and neutral.

By applying these refined definitions and examples, the model can better classify and distinguish between "Reported Issue / Idea / Feedback" and "Description or Definition or Background Context", leading to improved accuracy and more effective user engagement.
A Proposal that can still be discussed further: Here is a refined definition for "A Proposal that can still be discussed further":

**Definition:**

"A Proposal that can still be discussed further" refers to a statement that presents a potential solution, idea, or suggestion that is open to debate, refinement, or modification. It often includes phrases such as "We could...", "One option is...", "I propose that...", or "What if we...", and implies that input, discussion, or negotiation from others is invited before a final decision is made. This type of proposal is distinct from open-ended questions, which typically begin with words like "what", "how", or "why", and are intended to elicit information or opinions rather than propose a solution.

**Examples:**

* "We could implement a new marketing strategy to increase sales."
* "One option is to outsource the project to a third-party vendor."
* "I propose that we allocate more resources to the R&D department."
* "What if we were to launch a beta version of the product first?"
* "Let's consider partnering with a startup to accelerate innovation."
* "An alternative approach would be to revise our pricing strategy."
* "How about we pilot the new program in a smaller market first?"

This refined definition and examples aim to clarify the distinction between proposals that are open to discussion and open-ended questions that seek information or opinions. By recognizing the characteristic phrases and language used in proposals, the model can improve its accuracy in identifying "A Proposal that can still be discussed further".
Open-ended Question (normally WH Questions): Here is a refined definition for Open-ended Question (normally WH Questions):
